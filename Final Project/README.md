# Bike Share Case Study

At the end of the Google Data Analytics Certificate Program, we were asked to complete a case study using the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
The Bike Share case study provided us with a year's worth of data about customer behaviors, such as how long each bike ride is, whether the customer is an annual member or casual rider, and the day/time the customer is using a bike.
The business task was: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

The documents included in this section include my code in R to create the following visualizations
* Average Ride Length
* Most Frequent Day by Month
* Total Yearly Riders by Month

Looking at the FinalSummary.Rmd file, you can see my R markdown file for my final summary report.
In the FinalSummary.pdf, you can read a pdf version of my final report.
This includes and introduction, the methods that I used, the results of my analysis including visualizations, and my conclusion and further discussions section.
